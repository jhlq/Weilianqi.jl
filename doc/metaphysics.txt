Placing a unit with color (0,1,1) places a symbiotic organism that is both green and blue. Type game.color=(0,1,1) to place such units.

Make arbitrary animations with moving parts and timelayers.

Create timelayers, or dimensional layers that change physical constants. Bees, more bees, bees that can fly across dimensions.

We create streams of consciousness across the undefined darkness

#No one is innocent, by design. Everyone contributes by meditation. Meditation amplifies consciousness

Unittypes can be color coded, place darker red to imply a storage unit, or rainbow to have a multicolor connection central. Units with color (1,1,1) are special units that exactly fill up a hexagon without taking any space, maybe existing on a parallel plane

Black units are also present everywhere, providing the lite points and spawning queens.

Standard white units are stargates, warp in objects with loop shape

Organic layers can be grown on coloredly enclosed terrain, like kombucha symbiotic cultures. Open up a new board, include location info in name, place symbiotic culture veins and cells

Metagame: create games with arbitrary rules that use this board as a tool. If there are implementable changes submit pull request or open issue.

All points are made of white points in black points in a white point. LOL (triangle circle triangle), white black white
