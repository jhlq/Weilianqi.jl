Make snowflakes of light, lightflakes. With entrance units. What about entrance pussels? Yea, get in with the right pieces. Movable parts? Oooh! Press this button to lift this set of units. Unitset types! Develop sets! 

More tests! Why does travis test on 0.4? https://travis-ci.org/jhlq/Equations.jl Why do official JuliaGraphics packages fail tests? Dunno... ~.^ Zaaambiiieees, pollinating treeflowers. Treeflowerpollinating game! Make treesets and zambieepaths, loops can hold several zambiees! Maybe it is a upstream issue, a travisdam. Send a beaversquad! Beeaverunits!

Beehives in zambiees! make overlaping Beepaths. Moving parts ^.^ They know how to wait and sudo is required to overwrite politeness. Jamlite(eness?), traffic and jazz. Zambieesounds! Pointwaves, vibrations carry spores and information! Program wavegenerators based on sensory input

Ocean fractals rising up from endless dephts, make.

Draw arbitrary graphics on units. Draw arbitrary unitgraphic! Oooo such connections

Tunnelrace! 6 vertices of a giant hexagon hold storages with various surplusses, by connecting all of them with corresponding colors imbalances can be balanced. Only the first to connect across the board can do it without making tunnels..!

How about letting players move simultaneously and let their moves be in superpositions? Either resolved randomly where players may lay extra potential moves or by playing another game on the contested location.
Keep count on how many times each player has begun. No official komi, no official winner
Material is created with shapes they are surrounded to
Units emit pointgas so balance in colored units provide optimal gaspoints

#Zoomfunction is silly, unsillify it! How about calling center at value-changed? Yea, done!

#Units decay, white unit can auto repair. Units not connected to white decay
units not connected to white must build their own storage. In surrounded enclosure?
Placing units further from the white costs more. Or how about letting the distance one can place at increase as more points are gathered. Charge level on white unit also determines rate of placement
Choosing an arbitrary color and connecting to the center is like creating an account for that spot.
White units are storage for points and charging them becomes harder and harder, so by making roads one can distribute the points over many white points making it easier to gain points
#Harvesting gains points, bonds multiply points
#Influence majority determines paths
#lightpoints: [1,3,2]=>[0,2,1]+1lp
highways of mixed color can transport each color less but combined more
#a point cost per distance influence & 1 point cost per distance moved
#influencegroup, check if connected to white
store records in weilianqi/records
#decrease distance cost with better roads?
