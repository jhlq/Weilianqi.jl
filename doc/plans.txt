How about letting players move simultaneously and let their moves be in superpositions? Either resolved randomly where players may lay extra potential moves or by playing another game on the contested location.
Keep count on how many times each player has begun. No official komi, no official winner
Material is created with shapes they are surrounded to
Units emit pointgas so balance in colored units provide optimal gaspoints
type Game, save(game)
make borders on units so white doesnt disappear
Units decay, white unit can auto repair. Units not connected to white decay
Placing units further from the white costs more. Or how about letting the distance one can place at increase as more points are gathered. Charge level on white unit also determines rate of placement
Choosing an arbitrary color and connecting to the center is like creating an account for that spot.
Get group should include white, then checking for white connection is trivial
White units are storage for points and charging them becomes harder and harder, so by making roads one can distribute the points over many white points making it easier to gain points
Harvesting gains points, bonds multiply points
Influence majority determines paths
white points: [1,3,2]=>[0,2,1]+1wp
highways of mixed color can transport each color less but combined more
a point cost per distance influence & 1 point cost per distance moved
influencegroup, check if connected to white
store records and saves in .weilianqi
